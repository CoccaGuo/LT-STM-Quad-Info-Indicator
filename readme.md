This indicator works with a 'Nanonis LabVIEW TCP Interface', which turns the TCP query into a LabVIEW query, and maps the information through the LabVIEW interface, for the reason that the original TCP interface of Nanonis V5 is not stable on our computer.

This Indicator works without a cable line to the computer. It only needs a power supply.
